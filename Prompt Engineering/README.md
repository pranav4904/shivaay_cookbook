# ðŸŽ¯ Prompt Engineering with Shivaay

Welcome to the **Prompt Engineering** section of the Shivaay AI Cookbook!  
This guide helps you understand how to craft smarter prompts and fine-tune AI behavior using parameters like `temperature` and `max_tokens`.

##  What is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering is the **art of designing inputs** to guide an AI modelâ€™s response.  
By shaping system instructions, user prompts, and adjusting control parameters, you can:

- Improve accuracy   
- Encourage creativity   
- Customize tone or behavior

## ðŸ§  Key Parameters to Know

### ðŸŒ¡ `temperature`

Controls **randomness and creativity** in the AI's responses.

| Value Range | Behavior                        | Use Cases                    |
|-------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `0.2 â€“ 0.4` | More deterministic and focused | Factual Q&A, data tasks      |
| `0.7 â€“ 1.0` | More creative and diverse      | Storytelling, brainstorming, poetry |

> **Tip:** Think of `temperature` as the modelâ€™s *imagination level* ðŸ§ âœ¨

---

###  `max_tokens`

Controls the **maximum length** of the AIâ€™s response.

| Token Count     | Response Style              |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|
| 50 â€“ 100 tokens | Short answers, quick facts  |
| 300+ tokens     | Detailed essays, stories    |

> **Note:** If your response is cut off abruptly, try increasing `max_tokens`! ðŸ”§

## ðŸ’¡ Why is Prompt Engineering Important?

- It **guides AI to meet your needs** better  
- Helps avoid vague or irrelevant answers  
- Enables creative or formal tones as required  
- Makes AI outputs more predictable and useful

## ðŸ“š Examples in This Section

- How changing `temperature` influences creativity  
- How adjusting `max_tokens` controls response length  
- Using system messages to set AI personality and role
