# ðŸ¤– Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Shivaay LLM

This project demonstrates an **Agentic RAG** approachâ€”where an AI agent **plans**, **searches**, **retrieves**, and **reasons** in multiple steps to answer a complex question. The implementation is done using the [Shivaay LLM API](https://futurixai.com).

## ðŸ§© What Is Agentic RAG?

Agentic RAG goes beyond single-prompt RAG by simulating an autonomous agent that:
1. **Plans** how to answer the query.
2. **Generates sub-queries** for each step.
3. **Retrieves data** or simulates external knowledge.
4. **Synthesizes an answer** from all gathered context.

This multi-step reasoning pipeline is ideal for answering **complex, multi-faceted questions**.
