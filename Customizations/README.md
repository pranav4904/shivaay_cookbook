## 🔧 How to Customize Shivaay?

You can customize Shivaay mainly through:

1. **System Prompts** — set the overall assistant personality or role.  
2. **User Prompts** — dynamically tailor what the user asks.  
3. **Model Parameters** — like `temperature`, `max_tokens`, `top_p`, and more for fine control.  
4. **Context Management** — pass prior conversation messages or data for contextual replies.
